[f] @Consumers --> @Receives
  --> note that it shouldn't be useful in most cases as content types transit with messages
[f] @Produces --> @Sends (allow array of values like Jersey?)
[x] gather message data into an Event object?
[ ] body converters (reader/writer in Jersey)
  --> driven by content type
  [x] interface ==> using MessageBodyReader/Writer
  [ ] injection
  [x] String using encoding
  [x] bytes
  [x] JSON
    [x] Jackson by default
      [x] use injected ObjectMapper
[ ] parameter providers
  [ ] they should be available to normal injection (i.e. Guice) too somehow
    --> requires an InjectableProvider that is a factory of Injectables that are providers for specific events
  [ ] body (with the help of body converters)
  [ ] AMQP.BasicProperties
  [ ] Channel
  [ ] @BindingKeyParam
  [ ] properties params
    [ ] @ContentType
    [ ] delivery tag (necessary for ack)
  [ ] Event
  [x] Qarrot
[ ] RPCs
  [ ] can we return null values? --> test it
  [ ] if method returns "void", return null
  [ ] if method throws Exception, try to create an instance of the return type (if some payload object class)
    with a the (String, Throwable) constructor
  [ ] if no such constructor exists, return a RpcError as JSon with a "application/error" MIME type
  [ ] provide media type with response
[ ] route spec parser
[ ] auto-reconnect
  [ ] publish
  [ ] consume
[ ] allow persistence of published messages (for when RabbitMQ is not around) --> MessageStorage?
[ ] thread-safety of Qarrot and friends
[ ] look into an event custom-scope for Guice
[ ] AMQP shutdown
[ ] disconnections
  [ ] client
  [ ] server (see also persistence of messages)
[ ] use stuff from JAX-RS and simplify
[ ] scan parent injectors
[ ] our RuntimeDelegateImpl is going to create problems when integrating with Jersey (or other implementations)
  --> one possibility is to transfer it into a separate project
[ ] a RPC call that detects the MediaType (with JSON as the default for objects)
[ ] see what are the options to avoid dragging Guice into the arena by default
  --> could do something like Jersey Application
[ ] test injection of ObjectMappers
[ ] we shouldn't have to call configure if we don't have any module to provide
